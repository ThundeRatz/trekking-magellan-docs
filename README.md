# trekking-magellan-docs
Documentation regarding the ThundeRatz Trekking/Magellan project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## About
Docs to help others developing robots for these categories. Has general
environment setup instructions for code compilation and Doxygen output from other
repositories.

## Docs
Do NOT trust included Doxygen documentation. It is provided as a quick resource
for people needing project's documentation, but might be out-of-date. Always
check when the documentation was generated (open any html page and see the lower
right of the page). Although we try to keep it updated, generating the
documentation locally is the safest/recommended method. Just use
```
doxygen Doxyfile
```
at our repositories that have a Doxyfile.

## This is an incomplete version!
Pretty much incomplete :(. We are working hard to get this done with pictures
and data about the project and its challenges, problems we faced, etc. But it
will take some time.
